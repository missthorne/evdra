# This repository is intended to be used as the main place to store code during Gymnasiearbetet 2024.  

## The software above will work with our Electronic Vaporizer Disposal and Reprocessing Aparatus, EVDRA (or e-circuit as advised by the rest of the group)

NOTES:
The image classification shall be done using LabelImg and label-studio from the link below:
https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio
--
The files inside are intended to be used with virtual environments. 
The relevant yml files, alongside final code, will be present in the evdra_final directory
Currently, evdra_test shall serve as a demonstration of the model until the relevant database is constructed
