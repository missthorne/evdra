# This repository is intended to be used as the main place to store code during Gymnasiearbetet 2024.  
# The software above will work with our Electronic Vaporizer Disposal and Reprocessing Aparatus, EVDRA (or e-circuit as advised by the rest of the group)

Notes: 
The oddly named folders in the project directory are just places in which I check out different tutorials 

KerasCV/TensorFlow: basic tutorial resolved, some tutorials broken?, check code for details
